Leo's TODO List: (Updated Jun 14 2013):
 Verify the proof of Lemma 4.7.
 Explain the "simple reanalysis" mentioned at the end of section 4.2
 Make sure that the "parameter setting" section (Appendix D) really does provide a proof and an explanation for all the parameters of Theorems 4.8 and 5.4
 Take another pass over Section 4 -- probably my one pass was not enough.
 Go over section 5 with the same fine-tooth comb as over Section 4, probably twice. Go over Appendix B.


Ben's TODO List:
Need to be consistent about what size means.  In some places we use s_{rec} for circuit size and in others we mean running time.  Need to be consistent.

-Abstract:  
-Intro: 
--Polish further if time permits.
-- add a connection to Dodis-Smith as another relaxation that gives lossless.
-Preliminaries: 
--
-Definitions: 
-Construction:  
--Security: We make a claim that AGV is lossless it isn't.  Figure out loss.
--Efficiency: Remove unique witness garbage.

-Extension:  
--I think we should add some exposition about the proof, since it is interesting and stuff.

-References:  
--Should go through and check for misspelling, capitalization, etc.
-LWE extended: 

-Unique Witness:
--Need to eliminate this by saying that codes are high distance with high probability.
-Proofs:
--Main proof the notation needs to be consistent.
--Need to prove stronger version of claim about uniform b.

-Parameter Settings: 
--I'd like to be a little clearer about how to achieve linear stretch but I don't want to introduce another parameter.
