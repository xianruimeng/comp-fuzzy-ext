Wyner's constructrive result: if the input is uniform and the adersary's knowledge is BSC(input), then a good extractor is syndrome(input). (idea attributed to Mallows)


Wyner's paper has only five references: Winyer-Ziv for a lemma about entropy after BSC, two info-theory textbooks, Shannon, and Hellman. (stimulated the research)

Levin 1985-1987 (OWFs and PRGs) builds on Yao+Wyner:  Yao’s idea that Wyner’s techniques can be used in the computational setting. Amplifies hardcore bits and shows that bits of an error-correcting code are hardcore. First to proves Yao’s XOR lemma.

Superficial Mentions:

Simmons (Crypto 1984): Uses Wyner’s term “active wiretapper” (I couldn’t find this term) and talks about information-theoretic bounds on MACs. Widely cited — may be worth exploring the connection
