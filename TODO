Need to be consistent about what size means.  In some places we use s_{rec} for circuit size and in others we mean running time.  Need to be consistent.

-Abstract:  
-Intro: 
--Polish further if time permits.
-- add a connection to Dodis-Smith as another relaxation that gives lossless.
-Preliminaries: 
--
-Definitions: 
-Construction:  
--Security: We make a claim that AGV is lossless it isn't.  Figure out loss.
--Efficiency: Remove unique witness garbage.

-Extension:  
--I think we should add some exposition about the proof, since it is interesting and stuff.

-References:  
--Should go through and check for misspelling, capitalization, etc.
-LWE extended: 

-Unique Witness:
--Need to eliminate this by saying that codes are high distance with high probability.
-Proofs:
--Main proof the notation needs to be consistent.
--Need to prove stronger version of claim about uniform b.

-Parameter Settings: 
--I'd like to be a little clearer about how to achieve linear stretch but I don't want to introduce another parameter.
